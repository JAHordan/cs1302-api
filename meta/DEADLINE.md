    Part 1: App Description
     I am using the https://developer.transportapi.com/ API for Bus routes in England.
    I am also using the https://data.police.uk/docs/ API for Police reports in the UK.
    My app allows the users to select a town and bus stop, then it uses the BUS Api to match the in
    the system, and once it finds a match, it will get that stop's logitutde and latitiude values.
    It will use those values to plug into the Police API, and it will pull a list of crime reports from that location in
    a one mile radius.

    Part 2: New
    I learned how to use the toString method to turn my CopResponse object in to a string. I also learned how to read the
    json response from the API websites and coorlate that to how many extra classes I would need to make.

    Part 3: Differelty
    I would make the app look more visually appealing and see if could another API to get more locations outside of the UK.
